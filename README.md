# Drone_UI

This is a simple Drone GUI i made to learn QT.
It is written in QT6.9.1 educational version

If you want to run this, use QT6.9.1 at least, and open CMakeLists.txt as a project
The code is not made to run on other machine than mine, so dont expect it to run perfectly if you want to try.

Here are some images of the GUI
